Hello,
This is **Harsh Tripathi**. I will be joining the Class of 2022 of the *Masters in Analytics and Management Programme*.

### Background
I am a resident of **India**. I belong to the city of Lucknow, which is famous for its culture and monuments. 

Since the begining of my education, I was always intrigued by Math and Computers which led me to **major in Statistics** from the University of Delhi.

### Professional Experience
The wonderful experiences that I got in the following full time positions made me realize that I have a *knack for Analytics* -

1. Data Analyst Intern, MyGov India
2. Junior Data Scientist, Cars24 India
3. Risk Analyst, Uber India

Here is my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harsh-tripathi-2110/) for further information.

I have played **badminton** at the national level. With a will to contribute my bit to the society, I joined 2 NGOs and **educated underprivileged children**. Additionally, I am a sports fan and I like calling myself a movie buff.
